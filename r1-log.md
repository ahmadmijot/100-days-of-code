# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - [Max Mijot]

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [Jan 1, Monday, 2018].

## Log

### R1D0 (Yes I start at Day 0)
#### Planning and reasoning
Throughout this 100 days of code, I plan to learn about:
- Git (properly, via CLI) (first 15 days?)
- Python numpy and pandas (and a bit about Python visualisation) (next 30 days?)
- OpenCV or machine learning? (next 30 days)
- Javascript or Golang? (last 25 days)

For start, why git?
- To whet my appetite.
- Know a bit about git, but currently use GUI (Sourcetree, Gitkraken).
- When using GUI, I don't know what I am doing, I have no idea.
- So git should be ok to start this challenge for newbie like me.

Then Python Pandas (and Numpy)
- Know a lil bit about Numpy but not really familiar with Pandas.
- Will definitely use all these Numpy-Pandas-visualisation sooner or later.

If time permits, OpenCV, machine learning or learn new language i.e. JS or Go?
- OpenCV... I need to learn about this in my research, so is it still count? Or separate thing?
- Machine learning is good, seems more appropriate with this 100 days challenge theme.
- Javascript... currently exploring reveal.js for my presentation. Learned basic Javascript before (syntax and all) but maybe this time more specific to front-end dev, and a bit about fucntional programming?
- But then Golang seems nice language to learn. Esp to understand under the hood like concurrency and low level stuff. Can compare with Fortran for implementation.
- We'll see if I ever reach this last stage (final 30 days)

### R1D1
Re-learn the basic of git. Try to applied on reveal.js directory project (pull to bitbucket remote repo). It's more complex than I imagined. lol

### R1D2
Learnt about git rebase. Did I just screwed up with my repo?
