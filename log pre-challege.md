# Pre-100 Days Of Code - Log

## Preamble
### Reflection and reasoning

Since rules of #100DaysOfCode specifically mentioned that tutorials can't be count as code, so I started with "Pre-100 Days of Code".

I failed miserabily in my last attempt to do 100 Days of Code. But even for current attempt I'm not sure if I can proceed at least half the challenge. Therefore I think I need to start with something easier: pre-challege to get the feeling and set the step for real challenge later on.

For my PhD work, I need to understand and code with Python and a bit of Fortran, and learning hardware such as RPi and Arduino. But I also interested in learning other language such as Rust and understand how web works (front/back-end developer)

I'm currently busy with my experiment seup and got involved with other research projects. I think I may not able to religiously code everyday, but I'll try my best. Even if I code twice a week, but consistently do it, I satisfied.

### Planning
I code Python for my research project, Rust for tutorial (I have no idea about what kind of project that I can do with Rust), and sometimes poking around web development. So in this stage, I will shift between these two language, one for my real life research project, the other just for the sake of learning.

So for today R0D0, I start with Rust tutorial. Let's git started.

### Day 0: September 26, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Started Rust tutorial, configure Rust installation and basic Hello world tutorial

**Thoughts:** Although the installationa ns basic syntax is easy but configuration is something I still not clearly understand. Especially setting Cargo.toml.
P/s: I forgot how to change terminal in VS Code to bash! End up with Powershell.

### Day 1: September 30, 2019

**Note**: Skip a couple of days since I stayed up in my friends home and later went back to my hometown (I don't have laptop to do any works there)
**Today's Progress**: Change tutorial from A Gentle Intro to [Rust to The Rust Programming Language by Steve Klabnik and Carol Nichols](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/index.html#the-rust-programming-language) since it cover about Rust from very basic, including how to set up Rust environment and how to use Cargo from the very beginning.

**p/s:** While I'm writing this log, suddenly blackout! Part of the writin was missing. And I can't update it on time.

### Day 2: October 1, 2019

**Today's progress:** I stayed up in my friend's house and can't do anything regarding coding. But I read [Chapeter 3: Common Programming Concept](https://www.simonpbriggs.co.uk/rust.pdf) up until Functions.
