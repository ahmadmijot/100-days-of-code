# Pre-100 Days Of Code - Log

## Preamble
### Reflection and reasoning

Since rules of #100DaysOfCode specifically mentioned that tutorials can't be count as code, so I started with "Pre-100 Days of Code".

I failed miserabily in my last attempt to do 100 Days of Code. But even for current attempt I'm not sure if I can proceed at least half the challenge. Therefore I think I need to start with something easier: pre-challege to get the feeling and set the step for real challenge later on.

For my PhD work, I need to understand and code with Python and a bit of Fortran, and learning hardware such as RPi and Arduino. But I also interested in learning other language such as Rust and understand how web works (front/back-end developer)

I'm currently busy with my experiment seup and got involved with other research projects. I think I may not able to religiously code everyday, but I'll try my best. Even if I code twice a week, but consistently do it, I satisfied.

### Planning
I code Python for my research project, Rust for tutorial (I have no idea about what kind of project that I can do with Rust), and sometimes poking around web development. So in this stage, I will shift between these two language, one for my real life research project, the other just for the sake of learning.

So for today R0D0, I start with Rust tutorial. Let's git started.

### Day 0: September 26, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Started Rust tutorial, configure Rust installation and basic Hello world tutorial

**Thoughts:** Although the installationa ns basic syntax is easy but configuration is something I still not clearly understand. Especially setting Cargo.toml.
P/s: I forgot how to change terminal in VS Code to bash! End up with Powershell.

### Day 1: September 30, 2019

**Note**: Skip a couple of days since I stayed up in my friends home and later went back to my hometown (I don't have laptop to do any works there)
**Today's Progress**: Change tutorial from A Gentle Intro to [Rust to The Rust Programming Language by Steve Klabnik and Carol Nichols](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/index.html#the-rust-programming-language) since it cover about Rust from very basic, including how to set up Rust environment and how to use Cargo from the very beginning.

**p/s:** While I'm writing this log, suddenly blackout! Part of the writin was missing. And I can't update it on time.

**Link to work:** Cover [Chapter 2: Programming a Guessing Game](https://www.simonpbriggs.co.uk/rust.pdf)

---
### Day 2: October 1, 2019

**Today's progress:** I stayed up in my friend's house and can't do anything regarding coding. But I read [Chapter 3: Common Programming Concept](https://www.simonpbriggs.co.uk/rust.pdf) up until Functions.

**Link to work:** TODO: Cover Comments and Control Flow. Try to understand and code Ownership.

---
### Day 3: October 2, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Manage to do control flow chapter of Rust programming book. Also tried to setup OctoPi for my 3D printer project (Ender 3 Pro). But can't do ssh maybe problem with WiFi setup and due to the screen resolution is wet too high for my 3.5 Inch display. Need to change it later.

**p/s:** Today I get asked from someone about building a web page for some conference. I rejected the offer due to my lack understanding about web dev and Javascript. Another todo list: know how to build a basic web page.

**p/s2:** Tomorrow I will be out of town for some work for four days. I don't know how to do this challege for the whole time there.

**Link to work:** for [OctoPi](https://octoprint.org/download/)

### Day 3.5: October 3-7, 2019

**Today's Progress:** During this period, I read (but not code) about Rust Control Flow and [Ownership](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch04-00-understanding-ownership.html) concept.

---
### Day 4: October 8, 2019

**Today's Progress:** I tried to visualised my progress using git-like graph. I tried using [gitgraph/js](https://gitgraphjs.com/#0) however it's quite tricky to change it to suit my purpose where I can't remove hash number but other than that it seems easy to use provided that I know enough about Javascript framework.

For Rust programming, I tried poking around [Learn Rust With Entirely Too Many Linked Lists](https://rust-unofficial.github.io/too-many-lists/index.html) but it seems that the author assumed the readers have basic knowledge about Rust language, i.e. syntax and how to create and run library-ish. After I cover the basic about Rust, I might be try to read this book.

---
### Day 5: October 9, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Finish about Rust ownership (part I?)
A bit lost on the later part of the chapter.

**Link to work:** next is [References and Borrowing](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch04-02-references-and-borrowing.html)

---
### Day 6: October 10, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Finish about Rust References and Borrowing. I'm not really  understand about this concept though. Might read and practice about it later.

**Link to work:** [The Slice Type](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch04-03-slices.html)

### Day 7: October 11, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Today I tried to create a game in Rust (Roguelike). 
__Notes__:
1. Author use different way to execute program (cargo run --release). I stick to cargo check
2. Typo and syntax error. My main weakness so far. Mostly on ";" and on a lesser extend, "()".
3. Rust: 
   1. use xx::yy::zz
4. is similar to Python:
   1. import xx.yy.zz
5. Convention: use UPPERCASE letter for const
6. New thing that still not covered by reading Rust-lang: book:
   1. use
   2. struct
   3. cargo new --bin. The "--bin" part
