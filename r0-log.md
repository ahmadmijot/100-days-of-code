# Pre #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 0 - [Max Mijot]

The log of my Pre-#100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [Sept 26 2019].

## Log

### R0D0 [Sept 26]
#### Reflection and reasoning

Since rules of #100DaysOfCode specifically mentioned that tutorials can't be count as code, so I started with "Pre-100 Days of Code"

I failed miserabily in my last attempt to do 100 Days of Code. But even for current attempt I'm not sure if I can proceed at least half the challenge.

For my work, I NEED to understand and code Python and a bit of Fortran, and learning hardware such as RPi and Arduino. But I also interested in learning other language such as Rust and understand how web works (front/back-end developer)

I'm currently a PhD student and involved with other research project. I think I may not able to religiously code everyday, but I'll try my best.

###Planning
So here my plan: I code Python for my research project, Rust for tutorial (I have no idea about what kind of project that I can do with Rust), and sometimes poking around web development.

So for today R0D0, I start with Rust tutorial. Let's git started.


#R0D0
1. Start installing Rust and follow tutorial from [A Gentle Introduction to Rust](http://stevedonovan.github.io/rust-gentle-intro/).
2. The tutorial straight jump to hello world without mentioning about configure project structure (Project mainfolder > src > cargo.toml)
3. Stop at  [adding things up](http://stevedonovan.github.io/rust-gentle-intro/1-basics.html#adding-things-up)
